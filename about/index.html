<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>Northbrook Voices is an oral history project co-sponsored by the Northbrook Historical Society and the Northbrook Public Library. Our mission is to record and preserve the stories of life in Northbrook for the education and enrichment of future generations.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>You can tell the story of your experiences of living in Northbrook and what Northbrook has meant in your life. Each Participant will receive a CD recording of their 30-minute interview. Think of this as a friendly conversation between you and future generations who will be enriched by your story.</p>
