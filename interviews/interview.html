    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    <p>Tuesday is Friday March 13th 2015. Good afternoon and welcome to Northbrook voices an oral history project sponsored by the North Historic Society and the North British public library. My name is Susan Carrington and very pleased to welcome Judi Hughes who as many people know in Northbrook. She's been here for a little over 50 years and has done a tremendous amount of volunteering and we're in Northbrook during that time and we're going to we're going to talk to you about why you kind of came to north and then we're going to talk to you about all of the different volunteer work being done. So why don't you tell us how </p>
    <p>you came to know when my husband and I married we moved to a apartment in Northbrook. </p>
    <p>On land we're road. And the apartment we lived in was above a garage in a big old house and it was a spectacular little one bedroom apartment. </p>
    <p>And where was it honestly and where what was the first centers. </p>
    <p>It was just south of Willow Road on the west side of the street. </p>
    <p>Now there's a road named Brookside lane and Brookside Lane used to be the private driveway going to this house. The House has now been torn down and another one built in its place but it was a beautiful house with a central stairway. There was a second floor entrance for our landlords who live next door and we went up the stairs and turned to the right. And our apartment was above the garage. </p>
    <p>And it was one of those old world who had a big fireplace and had beautiful English dark wood paneling and cabinets that had stained glass in. </p>
    <p>It just it was a charming little little tiny one room apartment overlook the fields. Because at that time there was very little housing between where we lived and the naval air station and our back window. There was a barn and horses in the corral. </p>
    <p>And at certain times of the year we could see and hear of the tractor plowing the fields back there. </p>
    <p>The whole world was in the woods and I was going to ask if that was their year. And we lived there a little over a year. </p>
    <p>And our first child was born when we lived there and then we moved to Northbrook down town north on Lincoln Avenue. </p>
    <p>Did you buy a house. We did. The corner of Lincoln and meadow and we've been there ever since. We've added on to it twice but we're still in the same place and we were originally settled in Norfolk because my husband worked at Underwriters Laboratories at time. Later he became a fireman and so our second child was born and actually our. </p>
    <p>Next two children were born. So when we have done Lincoln and it was a great neighborhood when we first moved in there were probably 40 kids on our block and it's just a one block. </p>
    <p>Stretch of street. </p>
    <p>At that time Lincoln had not been expanded all the way to angles so that wasn't all a wooded rural kind of an area. </p>
    <p>How old were the houses that they were built in 54 we moved in in 63. OK so they about teen years and we were the third owners of our house and up until. Just a couple of years ago there were. There was at least one original. </p>
    <p>On the block but there were a lot of families that moved in with young kids about the same time we did. The original owners had been St. Stephen's Green It just opened up and they were moving. To that to that new neighborhood. They were great starter houses and we we made it are our everyday house just now just to start. Yeah. Everlasting house and. </p>
    <p>Our kids made great friendships. Kids went to Crestwood school. Our two older children went to Crestwood school. And they were out of Crestwood when. Crestwood was closed and our younger child is 12 years younger than. </p>
    <p>His sister. And. So he went to Greenbriar. </p>
    <p>You know Chris where it was located Crestwood is on Waukegan road. It was the original Shurmur middle school then the Northbrook school. Then the Waukegan Road School. That's where they had the first high school before Glenbrook was built. </p>
    <p>And then it became Krust with school about the same time me. They named Crestwood and I guess it was a contest between the kids. It's about that same time the. We went from having operator telephone to having a dial telephone system and our exchange at that time was Crestwood to which eventually morphed into two 7:02. </p>
    <p>So what was that about. </p>
    <p>Our son started there in 60 probably 60s. </p>
    <p>67 68 incrusted school at that time went up to what age it was kindergarten through sixth grade. And then they went to the junior high as well. Our younger son was at the Greenbrier that the junior high moved over to that the sixth grade and over to the junior high. And it was a it was a great old school and some wonderful teachers. And now of course it's Creswick place the senior citizen home. They had it on a week and I remember the day that Crestwood place opened I went on the open house tour over there with some of the teachers and it was fun to walk in the classrooms. They </p>
    <p>thought I'd see them converted into apartments. So that was a lot of fun in a year. Did your children walk over to Princeton. Absolutely. Absolutely. Couple a block walk to school and. All the kids walked in. It wasn't a big deal and as they said there were about 40 kids at one time on our on our block and everybody played out in front. And baseball games and you know it was just just wide open. I know. My son must have been in maybe fifth or sixth grade when he rode his bike up to Crestwood maybe he was maybe he was in sixth grade. He rode his bicycle up to Crestwood for a neighborhood game and got hit in the arm with a pitch and rode </p>
    <p>his bicycle home with a broken arm. You know in today's world parents are getting arrested when they let their kid walk alone for two blocks. It was just the way everybody did it. It was the kids went out and played and they knew that they had to be home at a certain hour when they were little we were all the mothers would gather on somebody's front porch and watch the kids. And it was it was a wonderful neighborhood for the kids to grow up in. And then they went all in and took the two. To Glenbrook high school. </p>
    <p>And our older son is a fireman in Wilmette. And our daughter works for all state. She now works from home but has been in Barrington and also at the Allstate facility on Sanders. And our younger son is working for the village that is Winnetka excuse me he works in the village of North as a water plant operator and my husband worked for the village. So it's somewhere so mad is a fireman husband works and when that guy is a fireman and then a water plant operator and then the water plant electric operator and then our younger son works at the water here. </p>
    <p>We have three grandchildren so 11 10 and 8. </p>
    <p>So I know you are very very involved in the kids education. I know that you are involved with the PTA and eventually the school board to kind of tell me about how that whole evolution. Well I remember somebody asking me when. Are you going to. </p>
    <p>Be in school. Did I want to be on the PTA board. And I said I don't think so. You know I'm just you know that's not something that interests me. And they talked me into it. </p>
    <p>And I had a great time and I had a great time mostly because we were making a difference for the kids at the school and we were. And I met some wonderful people that became lifelong friends and we worked well together. We started the art program where we went in and talk to kids about. </p>
    <p>Different art and we went through all of the schools. </p>
    <p>That was during my time that there were a whole lot of things like that the volunteer pool was very active at that time which got speakers and I did that as well for a while where I go into all the schools. I had a couple of programs that I did on civil war in colonial times and things like that for the kids. And it just was a wonderful opportunity. So then I was elected to PTA Council representing Crestwood school and. </p>
    <p>That was wonderful because it brought together all of the schools in District 28 together and we met once a month. </p>
    <p>And then I decided well what the heck had been on caucus and helped select candidates to run. </p>
    <p>And different for the village and for the library and for the school board that let me try out for the school board. </p>
    <p>So I did and I didn't make it the first time. </p>
    <p>And this is the district 28 SR 28 school board. Right. And didn't make it the first time but I tried again and I made it and I was on the school board for 14 years the last six. </p>
    <p>As president you make it you didn't make it to the caucus or you didn't make it through the caucus. They chose someone else which was fine cause I just continued going to school board meetings and learning more. </p>
    <p>And because at one of my PTA jobs had been as a representative from our PTA to the school board so I'd been going to school board meetings for a long time and thought I knew a school board ran well that's not the case until you were elected. You really don't have any idea how these things go. But. Harvey was the school superintendent and I I can say he. </p>
    <p>He became my mentor. </p>
    <p>He was a wonderful man who made you feel everyone he worked with almost everyone very special and you know he just kept telling me Judy you can do anything you want to do. And he was right. I did. </p>
    <p>I've done a lot of things that I never never in my life ever thought I could do. Well tell me what are some of those things. Well one of the things that happened in District 28 is so young. Who was the choral director there decided she wanted a way to teach the children that she was in her choir how to model that singing or music was a lifelong endeavor. </p>
    <p>So she started an adult choir called you all. </p>
    <p>I can't sing a note. It doesn't matter I can't read music. Doesn't matter doesn't keep me from singing when I want to sing. </p>
    <p>I love to sing. So I joined a choir and was with the choir for four more than 14 years. That was very near the end of my school board. And with that choir she took us to Carnegie Hall to the stage of Carnegie Hall. She took us to the Kennedy Center. We premiered music from. John Leavitt who is absolutely Specht secular composer. And it was a wonderful experience. I never thought I'd do something like that. You know I mean this is so out of my realm. And </p>
    <p>it was it was a great thing and working with some of the volunteer things like. </p>
    <p>There used to be what's called a youth commission at the Morefield food or field township. And it was during Reagan's time and there was revenue sharing so there was money that came back to the communities that we were able to put into the health care needs and the social the social needs of young people in our community. Eventually they formed the. As a youth and there was one for the adults and they formed them together. And I'm not sure that they're still working but they may still be giving small grants to some of these organizations like you know with the youth services and they're just a whole </p>
    <p>lot of youth services so I got to just meet and see how they all work with the kids and it was wonderful then. </p>
    <p>At the centennial time which was a few years after I left the school board a 95 marked was the president called and asked if I would chair the centennial Committee for the centennial that was coming up. </p>
    <p>Now the centennials in 2001. Right. And you had you the historic site in 88. So what made you decide to join this story beside you. </p>
    <p>Well it was one of my dear friends in my neighborhood friend who was also a teacher in District 28 when she retired from District 28. She started a children's program at the historical society and she needed some people who. </p>
    <p>She could help teach the history of the village to all of the students. </p>
    <p>And so we began in 88 and I think the first students came in 89 because she she retired in 88. The first students came that next school year the 88 school year. And that's where I began. </p>
    <p>So that's kind of involved in the docent program now or the children's program. </p>
    <p>Yeah. That's that was the start of it. Barbara Schultz is the one that started it we were neighbors for a long time before she went to school. Her kids were in third grade or so when she started teaching again in District 28. And. </p>
    <p>We'd been together in the neighborhood for maybe four years before that. Our kids played together. </p>
    <p>And so they kept asking me to be on the board. And I said No I was on the school. </p>
    <p>Board and that I just that was enough. I would do the children's program and then when I got off the school board I thought this would be a great thing to do. So I joined the board and. Have been on the board since. 1995 been president since 1999. </p>
    <p>Right. I keep telling them that it's the nominations committee that's got to fill out fill in the new people. You know I've been here a long time and then we've got to get some new blood so that this can pass on from generation to generation. </p>
    <p>So the Mike James came up to you and said we need we need to celebrate the centennial. I think that's when I met you because I went to the first meeting. Right. It was over at the Civic Association and was basically just to call people to come on people in the community. </p>
    <p>And we divided up and again that was another wonderful volunteer opportunity for. </p>
    <p>And I think most everybody who was involved in that then went on to do other things in the community and volunteer in other things you had already been doing some volunteering with here with your program talk around town and the village newsletter. But some people who had a passion for celebrating or telling the story of the village hadn't been involved in anything other village wide and I know quite a few of them did get involved in other village things. That's two of them are on the. </p>
    <p>Historical Society part. But it was a great time. </p>
    <p>And my gosh we together as a group planned figured out everything we were going to do and we know we should probably take a second and kind of talk a little bit. </p>
    <p>I think one of the first things that we did You were very instrumental was what we had the program at the high school. Yes. Now you actually wrote the script. </p>
    <p>I did. But really the committee the whole committee sat together and we decided how we wanted to celebrate. So we opened the centennial on November 18 2000 with a program at Glenbrook North. </p>
    <p>And what I wrote the script and we contacted all of the school music programs and so we had for I don't remember how many people were on stage at one. </p>
    <p>I think we had over a thousand people in the cast as it went that day. And so it's one. And so we told the story of our village using pictures. </p>
    <p>Michael Gorman who has grown up here and did a lot of work with CTV and is an actor and has this wonderful voice was our moderator. And then each of these groups starting from the elementary school told different segments of our community and we use the music of those decades to tell the history of our community. And yes I wrote the script so writing is another thing I never thought I would do but I had some of the resources through the historical society. And this </p>
    <p>was what we decided to do so we also decided we were going to write a book. And so again a call for volunteers and got all the people in who were willing to take a chapter in the book. And I wrote a couple little short sidebars in their civil war in the township and a couple of others. So I was one of 13 or 14 people who wrote the fabric of our history book and it won a state of war and with. And you know and I. Was Cheryl fayn we went and we hired a producer to do the </p>
    <p>fabric. The book is the fabric of our history and we have a video now a CD or DVD. The of the the tapestry and. </p>
    <p>They put together this 30 minute video that ended up playing on WTW won a national award from this county municipal organization that was nominated for a video. </p>
    <p>I never thought I'd do something like that. </p>
    <p>And you know it's just being in the right place at the right time and through connections and through hearing stories and listening to people finding people to come in and tell their story. I mean I just was the one that produced the list and went over the script with them and made changes in the script to make it right. So I'm listed as the producer. </p>
    <p>My goodness. That's not something I would think I want to know. </p>
    <p>However you also are a patron of the arts because you were very instrumental in getting the water fountain that we have for the plaza and Tindale Plaza as well of all the stops officers. </p>
    <p>Yeah that's very true and that's another one of those. There was a decision by the group that we wanted to do leave a lasting gift and that was the Plaza. And so I sort of worked with the park district and we I sent out bids to different sculptors all over the country after going to some sculpture fairs to find out about different pieces and going and looking at different pieces. And the committee as a whole. </p>
    <p>Put together I remember the lower level of your stock suddenly having all of these all across the room all of these sculptures and making a decision as to who we were going to have. </p>
    <p>Who would you hire to bring it in. </p>
    <p>And then I went about we went on we went about raising the money to do that. </p>
    <p>And we you know through the brick sales and the sales of the book and the sales of memorabilia kinds of things and it was a whole committee. We were in different. There was a memorabilia committee and there was a centennial day Committee which you chaired and there was the fire department because it was their 100th birthday and they were just all of these different committees that worked to get this done. And I can remember standing at the end of the day and I was it June that we had that wonderful answer and it was a day long event with it started with the fire department </p>
    <p>parade the dedication of the of the. </p>
    <p>Plaza with people's names on their bricks and was all the events that day or was it the next day we had over the weekend. </p>
    <p>That's what I thought. </p>
    <p>But that night we had a street dance and we had a laser light show and I can remember standing way way back in the crowd and you know in the beginning there was nobody there and then watching all these wagons and these people coming in and you know and all the work you and your committee did to make that day happen. </p>
    <p>I mean I was the chairman who was just sort of filtering everything out. But it was the committees that worked so hard to get that done. And I remember sitting back and I was leaning against one of those gorgeous trees the village green and those. And. </p>
    <p>Watching all these people come in. And it got dark and this laser light show went on and people were just so enthralled with what was going up on the screen and thinking wow it really worked. </p>
    <p>I am sure you felt that same way that day. </p>
    <p>And we had a tremendous turnout. </p>
    <p>Oh we did it too and it's both days even. </p>
    <p>You mean the next day everybody came. </p>
    <p>And it was just a giant fair in the village green and everybody everybody having a good time with their neighbors and telling stories about the community which is just to me as is so so vital to the health of our community is to share time with your neighbors like that. So the centennial was an absolutely wonderful experience for me personally and I hope for the rest of the committee people on the committees and I think for a lot of people it made a difference in how they see the village and celebrating. So that that was </p>
    <p>absolutely wonderful. And so that sort of led to the arts commission because once there was no Centennial. </p>
    <p>You had so much free time. </p>
    <p>You know that's not how it happened at all. </p>
    <p>Mark Damie is called a meeting of people interested in art. And so I went because I was interested in promoting the arts in our community. </p>
    <p>And there I don't know there were maybe 20 or so people there and they were talking. One woman remember I remember her saying something to the effect of I've been an artist in our community. For many many years. And I didn't know a single other artist until I came here today. It's wonderful. And so this is just such a great thing. So you went around and asked everybody if they would be willing you know if they really thought it was a good idea and everybody said yes they thought it was a really good idea. </p>
    <p>And he said well that's good cause I'm appointing Judy who's chairman. </p>
    <p>He didn't say a word to me before I walked in that door and I went OK. So I was chairman of the first Arts Commission and I stayed on there for 10 years from 2000 to 2012 and we had liaison from the park district in the library and through our library liaison we had Northpark originals which is our very first Northbrook artist's. </p>
    <p>Art display here. You can come here as a as an individual but we've never had anything. </p>
    <p>We also had a student art that right away and we've done a whole lot of things the art in the park that starts in July is through was started during my tenure as chairman there. But again each of these things and I should say the Arts Commission is a village commission as opposed to the historical society which is an independent 501 c3 where we raise all our own funds through membership and things and grants in any way we can get to get money. </p>
    <p>To support our mission of telling the story the history of our village. The Arts Commission is a village commission so it's appointed by the village. And so therefore it runs under slightly different do. So the board has to approve of what we do. And it's been a wonderful. Venue for artists in our community for offering arts opportunities for supporting the library which in all is truly the cultural heart of our community with all the the </p>
    <p>programming they do here so. So it's through grants that they are able to provide some of the help for some of the programs that are done here. And I think arts and. </p>
    <p>Destinations like a museum and build in enormous economic development for our community because when people come into your community to visit an art show or to come to a museum they tend to stay in the community and have lunch or dinner in the community go into the stores and spend money. So it's more than just art. Learning about history. It provides a real benefit to our community and I think that the village saw that with the Arts Commission which is part of </p>
    <p>why Mike Mark wanted to do that. And there are some other commissions with a village like the ICC which is works with the business community. </p>
    <p>I've served on the EDC I was the first which is the economic development committee. </p>
    <p>We are going to talk about this a little bit about the downtown group. </p>
    <p>I serve not one of those two or a few years. </p>
    <p>Yeah. </p>
    <p>And so the village of Northbrook has been so blessed to have people willing to give of their time and talents to these various commissions. And there have been. The people that serve on the Planning Commission. </p>
    <p>I served on the Plan Commission for one year as a representative through the schools at that time. The schools in the park Torrens park district two turns with one representative. I had a year on the plan the plan commission and people think they go up there and they you know just sort of were working in a vacuum. </p>
    <p>The the packet arrived at my house the week before that meeting had to be some time anywhere. </p>
    <p>Most of the time. Six inches tall and sometimes 12 inches tall. </p>
    <p>And what you have to read and an understanding go through before that time is tremendous. </p>
    <p>I was put on the economic development the EDC commission and I think that's probably why I ended up in the downtown one in 98. </p>
    <p>I think it was something that because of my time on the EDC I was put on that as a representative of district 28 because each of the schools in the park and the library all have representatives of that. </p>
    <p>So you know it's for me it's often been a matter of being in the right place at the right time. And I was raised my parents divorced when I was very young and my dad was in the service at the time and later on when he got out of the service went back to teaching and was very involved in his community. </p>
    <p>My grandfather my dad's father was very involved in his community and my mother here was very involved in in Glenview where we lived. </p>
    <p>And you know as a kid she used to drag us to Glenview days and we had to work at her. She worked for the Chamber of Commerce and that's just what we did. </p>
    <p>And so we all were expected to give back to our community. So you went to. True. It's weird because I lived on the east side of. </p>
    <p>We lived at first and then the east side of Glenview. And. So it was in the new district. </p>
    <p>So you know it's just always something that you want to do when you do such a tremendous job. And that's why you're being volunteered to chair. And you know I know that you know people really enjoyed working with you and really you know the experience that I had on this and me it was wonderful. And I mean those people who I still met there that I talk to like you know they're great friends now. </p>
    <p>Absolutely. And really it's really helps. You know volunteering is. A wonderful experience and I worry about the state of volunteer. </p>
    <p>In the future and whether because technology was supposed to help us save time and I sometimes wonder if it doesn't take all of our time. </p>
    <p>And with both parents working now and family life differ sometimes there isn't time be in a family's day to day schedule to volunteer. </p>
    <p>I know I was interested in the historical society long long before I joined the board or joined as a docent there for the children's program but I had little kids you know and I couldn't I I couldn't give any more time than I was already giving to the PTA. </p>
    <p>I could do that when my kids were in school some of the other things had to be nighttime meetings and with my husband being a fireman he worked one 24 hour shift and was home for two shift where he worked a second job. </p>
    <p>So I couldn't be leaving my kids all the time with babysitters all the time to do these things. So it's it really changes the dynamic. </p>
    <p>So of how you give your time back to your community. </p>
    <p>And I've also found that a lot of people really can only give their time in the evening for the daytime not quite as much as they are or unless they're you know older or retired. Right. </p>
    <p>But to get the really young people because a lot of them are working in the houses for their volunteer time is given to their children's activities their family activities. </p>
    <p>So it's it's not it's not as easy because for the historical society we we have a lot a lot of volunteer opportunities and we have a lot of volunteers. They are my age or older and. </p>
    <p>And have been for you know most of the time I was one of the young ones when I started and there's only a couple still younger than me but and I'm not young anymore. </p>
    <p>So it's time to groom the next generation to begin to step forward and do some of the things that need to be done. </p>
    <p>So it's just it's just been out. Northbrook has been a wonderful opportunity and I wrote a I wrote a line and I've used it a whole lot for that. </p>
    <p>The closing of that centennial opening program over at the high school. And it goes to sort of how I see Northbrook and maybe my love of antiques and love of things of beauty. But I love Patrick quolls beautiful patchwork quilt. And some of those old velvet ones that you know just have. The writing on the. </p>
    <p>Stitching on the top. And I think of North pre-cursor as a quilt you know and each of the squares or each of the pieces in it have their own history and they're and they're strong and they're they're vital on their own. But as when we all joined together that we put together a thing of beauty. </p>
    <p>And a piece of a piece of our history and that we were together for the betterment of our community. I mean it's just really important. So what do you see in the future for you. Well what I'm doing I love I sometimes I could use a little help I love if I had my preference for what I could do at the historical site I would write I would research. </p>
    <p>Both our village history and family history for our community I love family history for myself my own family the family of my friends. You know I'm always up stuff for them. </p>
    <p>If I could do that that would be my future. </p>
    <p>I'd love to do more traveling but it sometimes is kind of hard to get away. My husband's been retired for a few years and he says he now works for me at the circus society. </p>
    <p>But you know without my husband I couldn't have done half of what I done given hours. </p>
    <p>You know I just I couldn't you let all the events there was Judy and then we knew your husband was just. </p>
    <p>We could always count on him being there for sure and doing whatever anybody needed had to be done. And Northbrook voices is something that I am really passionate about. </p>
    <p>And it's it's an interesting story because I think it was WIOD radio did a series of interviews with people here in Northbrook back in the early 60s when it was a time we had just begun the huge growth and the population was X banding it lead by leaps and bounds. </p>
    <p>And our western boundaries were growing and so it was no longer area becoming neuter. </p>
    <p>And it had been that way since the 50s but it was a time of huge growth. </p>
    <p>And so they called in every civic leader and they ran a half an hour interview every day and A&E for a week talking about why Northbrook was a great place to live and how they had handled all of this and why their schools their clubs I mean the women's club the Rotary Club the village president Bert polic who guided this community through all of that major growth. </p>
    <p>And the board that worked with them. The school superintendent Homer Harvey and all of the other school superintendents and they probably added up to Norman Watson I think and and Shealey are both former school superintendents whose names you see on buildings at Gombrich. </p>
    <p>And they played this on the radio. </p>
    <p>And I came across an article I stumbled on an article about this and tried locating these recordings and they don't seem to be anywhere. They're not in the broadcast museum that I can find. </p>
    <p>I need to call and have see if I can prevail on somebody to to search further. </p>
    <p>I talked to A&E radio. Nobody has these interviews on tape and we have lost and tire first person history of our community and there was a saying I ran across that it's an African proverb that when an old man dies a library book ends and I look at the historical society as the library of the past the present and the future that we need to keep the stories together. </p>
    <p>And I was talking to Nancy bishop here in the reference department at the library about this and we've done some oral histories but it wasn't organized and we had some from back in the bicentennial when the girl scouts went out and talked to some of these people like Martha Lorenz who was the mother of the grandmother of now anyway she is the mother of the Arends family. So she you know she remembers her grandparents who were the ones that first heard stories of our great grandparents were the first ones who settled here. </p>
    <p>So we had first person from them and then there's this gap during this growth. It just can't happen again. </p>
    <p>So Nancy and I were talking because we talk about genealogy and family history because we already had a partnership working with the village helping people do their genealogy from this area. And I was telling her the story and she said you know it's really funny that you mention that because we've been talking about oral history and I went back and that's how it happened. </p>
    <p>And then you joined the crew here and Donna Ghaly has consistently done the interviews I've done interviews and there's a few others that have flitted in and out and done an interview or two. So but I really think that this is important that we leave that we leave a history of what our community was like at the time that we lived here for the for the future generations because you know you don't really sometimes understand. </p>
    <p>Why something is some way unless you know the history. I mean you've always known there's an underpass over here you didn't know. That there didn't used to be the underpass and you didn't know the kind of struggles that the village went through to get that built and the and the referendum that you had to convince the voters in this library there was a reading room over in the village hall for a while before the library. </p>
    <p>But when they went to referendum to build a library in town during that time of great growth it won by six votes and the first library was built with funds from civic at the corner. It's the cats building now at the corner of Shurmur and church. And by the time they occupied it it was almost too small so they put an addition on it. And I think that was in the maybe 54 55. I don't always have the date exactly on the top of my head my head is filled with too much. </p>
    <p>Minutia then they then they built an addition to it right away. </p>
    <p>And by 1966 they'd built this library here in this place because those two were too small. </p>
    <p>Well it's a nice story about the growth of the library but it really is a story about how people in our community how many more people in our community had come and how the services and the things that we needed to provide for our community couldn't be provided in the space that we had now. So it's it's just an interesting story and to me I love it. </p>
    <p>I love telling the story of our village in different different ways and writing for the tower now and the village newsletter once a month helps us get the stories told. </p>
    <p>It's just absolutely. Well I think your time's about out there be sure it is. </p>
    <p>I want to thank you very much. It's been a great interview. Wonderful to learn. I know that you're probably going to. I don't know. I mean at some point you're going to have to record all the things you know about college because you're definitely a library. </p>
    <p>And and I'm. But I want I want you to understand that when I came in as a village docent back for that for the children's program back in 1988 I didn't know anything. And when I first came on the board I said Well where is your history and they showed me the boxes. They had it in. And my question I I just have to ask questions. How do you know this. What's your proof that this is done. So we set out to do the research. That's how we wrote the book. We did all the research ahead and found the articles that explained what was happening at that time. </p>
    <p>So there's not I forget more than I remember today. And I'm learning something new every day. </p>
    <p>We get people from all over the country all over the world who contact us with questions that sends us off on an adventure to try and find information about something. So that's what I love doing. </p>
    <p>Well I want to thank you very much for participating and report for duty and your memories of in your history of knowledge of life in Norfolk and a unique and personal perspective about the history of our village. </p>
    <p>Thank you very much. Thank you. </p>
